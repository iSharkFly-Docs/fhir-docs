# Naming Conventions
In simple terms, a naming convention refers to a framework used for naming your files in a specific way.

## Classes
Class names should be nouns, in mixed cases with the first letter of each internal word capitalized. Interfaces names should also be capitalized just like class names.

## Methods
Methods should be verbs, in mixed case with the first letter lowercase and with the first letter of each internal word capitalized.

## Variables
Variable names should not start with underscore _ or dollar sign $ characters, even though both are allowed.

## Packages
The prefix of a unique package name is always written in all-lowercase ASCII letters and should be one of the top-level domain names, like com, edu, gov, mil, net, org.
